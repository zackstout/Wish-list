# Wish List

## Clear directives:
- [x] Complete user interface for spirograph.
- [ ] Make spirographs more efficient: i.e. don't redraw entire path each frame.
- [ ] Complete runtime races.
- [ ] Group poets in DB by genre, epoch, sentiment.
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the Menger Sponge.
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the 3d snow vector field (perhaps with quadtree).
- [ ] Hook Python3 up to MySQL without Django.
- [ ] Build Menger sponge (with quadtree??) in C#.
- [ ] Complete interface for cellular automata: let user drag mouse to select values for starting row.
- [ ] Do Project Euler problems in Java or C# or Ruby to learn syntax/principles of efficiency.
- [ ] Perhaps do the same for sorting algorithms.
- [ ] Fix census regression loop so that it correctly runs each pair of axes.
- [ ] Build an app that lets users input a grid size and then numbers one by one to create a Pandas dataframe.
- [ ] Convert Shakespeare CSVs into SQL database (tables for Play, Speaker, Line).
- [ ] Scrape data from [Poetry Foundation](poetryfoundation.org) for more poems (also eras, schools, etc.).
- [ ] Create API for which Rick and Morty is playing on the stream at a given time. 

## Blockers:
- [ ] Determine whether a pixel lies within the leaf of a given plant (phyllotaxis genetic algorithm).
- [ ] Find a usable PDF parser.
- [ ] Transform to polar coordinates with variable center (star map).
- [ ] Figure out how to schedule function calls with Python3 (weather app).
- [ ] Add images to p5 canvas (*Love Actually* visualization).

## Invitations to brainstorm:
- [ ] Add permutations to the simulations run via Electronic-Life (starting energy, requisites for reproduction).
- [ ] Automate these simulations so that we have data to analyze.
- [ ] Play with circle inversions; try to get hyperbolic reflections showing up.
- [ ] Explore relation between spirograph and Fourier transformations.
- [ ] Analyze the dataset about sleeping alone. Need to parse data into numbers.
- [ ] Find an inspiring idea for exploring Rails: perhaps the Shakespeare project for which we've already scraped the data.
- [ ] Animate transition between rectangular and polar coordinates.
- [ ] Enrich the parabolic shooter game.
- [ ] Continue exploring d3.
- [ ] Build (and understand) a neural network.
- [ ] Sketch a fractal tree that looks like a real tree.
- [ ] Create animation that illustrates Stokes' Theorem, with Perlin noise.
- [ ] Build 2048
- [ ] Explore coding with Prolog (formal logic language) -- use Greek mythology family tree for fun sandbox.
- [ ] Use d3 to illustrate different sorting algorithms (two birds one stone!).
- [ ] Learn Redux and Haskell, generally explore functional programming.

## Don't forget to blog!
- [ ] Pandas, linear regression
- [ ] Scraping Wikipedia
- [ ] OOP and "this"
- [ ] Efficiency issues
- [ ] Getting setup with Django/Rails, MVC-style
- [ ] Spirograph
- [ ] Cellular Automata
