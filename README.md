# Wish List

## Clear directives:
- [x] Complete user interface for spirograph.
- [ ] Make spirographs more efficient: i.e. don't redraw entire path each frame.
- [ ] Complete runtime races.
- [ ] Group poets in DB by genre, epoch, sentiment.
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the Menger Sponge.
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the 3d snow vector field.
- [ ] Hook Python3 up to MySQL without Django.

## Blockers:
- [ ] Determine whether a pixel lies within the leaf of a given plant (phyllotaxis genetic algorithm).
- [ ] Find a usable PDF parser.
- [ ] Transform to polar coordinates with variable center (star map).
- [ ] Figure out how to schedule function calls with Python3 (weather app).
- [ ] Add images to p5 canvas (*Love Actually* visualization).

## Invitations to brainstorm:
- [ ] Add permutations to the simulations run via Electronic-Life (starting energy, requisites for reproduction).
- [ ] Automate these simulations so that we have data to analyze.
- [ ] Play with circle inversions; try to get hyperbolic reflections showing up.
- [ ] Explore relation between spirograph and Fourier transformations.
- [ ] Analyze the dataset about sleeping alone.
- [ ] Find an inspiring idea for exploring Rails: perhaps the Shakespeare project for which we've already scraped the data.
- [ ] Animate transition between rectangular and polar coordinates.
- [ ] Enrich the parabolic shooter game.
- [ ] Continue exploring d3.
- [ ] Build (and understand) a neural network.
